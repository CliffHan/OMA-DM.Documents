# 1.2 Introduction

As differentiation between Device types grows and Device functionality broadens, the difficulty in provisioning these Devices with service-specific parameters and software increases.<br/>
随着设备类型的差异化和设备功能的扩大，为这些设备配置服务特定参数和软件的难度增加。

In addition, Device administration servers and systems face an increasingly difficult task in keeping track of the status and configuration of the Devices they manage.<br\>
此外，设备管理服务器和系统跟踪其管理的设备的状态和配置的任务变得越来越困难。

A Device is any User terminal which is primarily used in mobile scenarios. They may be equipped with a smart card (where applicable), which is under the sphere of influence of a specific Management Authority. The scope of Device Management includes both the Device itself and smart card. A Device could be, for example, a WAP- or MMS-capable handheld, a smart phone, PDA, or a notebook computer. PDAs, handhelds, smart phones and notebooks can be attached to a wireless modem via hardware integration, cable, IR, and Bluetooth.<br\>
设备是主要用于移动场景中的任何用户终端。他们可能配备有智能卡（如适用），这是在特定管理机构的影响范围内。设备管理的范围包括设备本身和智能卡。设备可以是例如具有WAP或MMS能力的手持设备，智能电话，PDA或笔记本计算机。 PDA，手持设备，智能手机和笔记本电脑可以通过硬件集成，电缆，红外和蓝牙连接到无线调制解调器。

Each of the requirements may limit the target Device to the specific subset of capabilities of a Device considering the fact that each of the Devices has different constraints from each other due mainly to capabilities in particular for mobile phone handset. When such requirements or use cases are specified, the capabilities of Device(s) that each requirement or use case is targeting should clearly be described in this specification. Devices which are under the control of a Management Authority should support transparent forced setting of all parameters covered by the Management Authority Control.
The actors involved in Device Management include Management Authorities (including Network Operators, Enterprise Managers, Service Providers), Device Management Systems, Subscribers and Users.
The objective of this document is to develop a standardized approach to Device Management.
